![](https://i.ibb.co/jVQFBpS/pngfuel-com.png)

### Description
In this project we see an implementation of speech recognition using MFCC and Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) in 4 different models:
* Perceptron
* CNN with one-layer convolution
* CNN with two-layer convolution
* CNN with two-layer convolution + Dropout
* LSTM

### Data
Data of this implementation includes 65,000 one-second long utterances of 30 short words. You can download this dataset in [this](https://www.kaggle.com/c/tensorflow-speech-recognition-challenge) link.
